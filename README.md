`[Python | Keras| CNN]`

Welcome to the "Deep Learning Brain Tumour Image Classification using CNN" repository! This project was developed as part of the "Data Mining and Machine Learning II" course, focusing on deep learning tools and techniques.

**Abstract:**

Brain tumours, characterized by the growth of abnormal cells or masses in the brain, pose a significant medical challenge. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a common diagnostic method for detecting brain tumours, generating a large number of images. Manual identification of brain tumours from these images is prone to errors, whereas deep learning-based classification approaches offer promising results.

This project aims to address the challenges in medical image processing by leveraging deep learning and advanced image processing technologies. Specifically, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is employed to classify brain images. The brain scans are categorized into four classes: no tumour, glioma, meningioma, or pituitary tumours. The Brain Tumour Classification dataset from Kaggle is utilized for this project.

To evaluate the performance of the constructed model, various metrics such as the confusion matrix, accuracy, F1 score, recall score, and precision are employed.
